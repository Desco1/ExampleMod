# ExampleMod
A template for 1.8.9 Forge Kotlin mods with Essential (unfortunately).\
Also includes a bunch of commons like a packet event, a blank [Config](https://github.com/EssentialGG/Vigilance) and [Mixins](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/wiki).

This is really just a way for me to point people to somewhere to start.\
Credits to [Debug](https://github.com/Debuggingss) for the fixed [ForgeGradle](https://github.com/Debuggingss/ForgeGradle); and my ADHD hyperfixated brain for pulling through learning [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
